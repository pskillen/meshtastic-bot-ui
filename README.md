# MeshtasticBotUI

A React-based user interface for the MeshtasticBot project.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm 9.x or later
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:staged` - Format only staged files with Prettier
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run prepare` - Set up Git hooks (runs automatically after `npm install`)

### Git Hooks

The project uses Husky to manage Git hooks:

- **Pre-commit hook**: Automatically runs before each commit

  - TypeScript build check (`tsc -b`)
  - ESLint check (`npm run lint`)
  - Prettier format check (only on staged files)
  - Tests (`npm test`)
  - Ensures that only code that passes all checks can be committed
  - To skip the pre-commit hook (not recommended), use `git commit --no-verify`

- **Commit-msg hook**: Validates commit message format
  - Ensures commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
  - Example: `feat: add new feature` or `fix: resolve bug in component`

The Git hooks are automatically set up when you run `npm install` thanks to the `prepare` script in package.json. If you need to manually set up the hooks (for example, after cloning the repository), you can run:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

This will install and configure Husky to manage the Git hooks for this project.

## Build Process

### Docker Build

The application is containerized using a multi-stage Docker build process:

1. Build stage:

   - Uses Node.js 20 Alpine as base
   - Installs dependencies
   - Builds the application
   - Injects version from build argument

2. Production stage:
   - Uses Nginx Alpine as base
   - Serves static files
   - Runs as non-root user for security

### Versioning

The application version is injected during the build process:

- Development: Uses 'development' as default version
- Production: Version is set from GitHub release tag or manual build argument

### Multi-Architecture Support

The Docker image is built for multiple architectures:

- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64

## Deployment

### GitHub Container Registry

Images are automatically built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) on:

- Release publication
- Manual workflow trigger

### Available Tags

- `latest` - Latest stable release
- `latest-rc` - Latest release candidate
- `{version}` - Specific version (e.g., v1.0.0)
- `{version}-{platform}` - Platform-specific builds

- Loads default configuration from `config.ts`
- Can be overridden by a remote `config.json`
- Supports environment-specific settings
